# ZMPO Project - Interactive Drawing and Reconstruction

This project was developed for the ZMPO course. The application allows users to draw objects on the screen. Once the drawing is complete, the application performs an image reconstruction based on the drawn shapes using simulated hand movements, which follow the previously tracked mouse positions.

## Features

- **Interactive Drawing:** Draw objects on the screen using a hand.
- **Image Reconstruction:** Rebuilds the image after the drawing process is completed.

## Installation

To set up the application locally for development, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YoungVigz/ZMPO
cd ZMPO

# Install project dependencies
npm install

# Run the application
npm run dev
```
